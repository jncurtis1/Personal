I am an experienced program and project manager with extensive work experience at Microsoft Corporation.  I am in the midst of upgrading my skill set, learning the statistical programming language, R, and SQL.  I expect to eventually pick up Python.  My goal is to combine my PM skills with my understandingo of R capabilities to manage major data analytics projects.
